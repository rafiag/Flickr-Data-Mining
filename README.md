# Flickr-Data-Mining

In this project I try to use geotagged photo from Flickr to understand the characteristics of foreign tourist visiting Bali, Indonesia. This repository consisted of three Python notebook:
1. FlickrCrawler: this notebook is used to collect data using th API provided by Flickr. For more information you can check the [documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
1. Clustering: cluster the data based on their latitude and longitude either using OPTICS or DBSCAN algorithm and visualize the result.
1. Markov_Chain_Modelling: build markov chain model to see how tourist likes to move from one cluster to another.

Here are a couple of visualization result I did for this project:

[Markov chain visualization](/Image/Markov Chain.png)
